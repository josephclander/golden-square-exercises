## 1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can manage my time
I want to see an estimate of reading time for a text, assuming that I can read 200 words a minute.

## 2. Design the Method Signature

```
# `reading_time` returns a time in minutes given the text as a string
time = reading_time(text)

# - text: is a string with words in it
time: time in minutes rounded to the lowest integer (e.g. 6 [1250 / 200 = 6.25])

```

## 3. Example Tests

```ruby
# EXAMPLE
reading_time("") => 0
reading_time(1200_WORDS) => 6
reading_time(1250_WORDS) => 6
reading_time(nil) => throws an error

```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
